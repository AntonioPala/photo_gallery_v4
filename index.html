    <p>I love hay bales. Took this snap on a drive through the countryside past some straw fields.</p>
    <p>The lake was so calm today. We had a great view of the snow on the mountains from here.</p>
    <p>I hiked to the top of the mountain and got this picture of the canyon and trees below.</p>
    <p>It was amazing to see an iceberg up close, it was so cold but didnâ€™t snow today.</p>
    <p>The red cliffs were beautiful. It was really hot in the desert but we did a lot of walking through the canyons.</p>
    <p>Fall is coming, I love when the leaves on the trees start to change color.</p>
    <p>I drove past this plantation yesterday, everything is so green!</p>
    <p>My summer vacation to the Oregon Coast. I love the sandy dunes!</p>
    <p>We enjoyed a quiet stroll down this countryside lane. </p>
    <p>Sunset at the coast! The sky turned a lovely shade of orange.</p>
    <p>I did a tour of a cave today and the view of the landscape below was breathtaking.</p>
    <p>I walked through this meadow of bluebells and got a good view of the snow on the mountain before the fog came in.</p>
